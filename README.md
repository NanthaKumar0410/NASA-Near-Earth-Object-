# NASA Near-Earth Object (NEO) Tracking & Insights
This project fetches, processes, and visualizes data from NASA's Near-Earth Object (NEO) API. It provides insights into asteroids approaching Earth, their velocity, distance, potential hazards, and other parameters using SQL and Streamlit. The application helps in tracking and analyzing asteroid information in an interactive and user-friendly way.

##  **Project Overview**

Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) are asteroids and comets with orbits that bring them close to Earth's orbit. NASA provides an API that tracks these objects, providing crucial data for scientific research and hazard assessment.

This project leverages the NEO API to extract data, process it, store it in relational databases, and generate meaningful visualizations through Streamlit. It’s a complete pipeline — from data extraction to insights — aimed at astronomers, data scientists, and enthusiasts.
